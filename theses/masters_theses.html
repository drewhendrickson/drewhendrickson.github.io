      <p><em>Abstract:</em> The goal of this research was to determine if clustering mobile phone data can be used to
segment users into groups based on their behavior. Previous studies have attempted to profile
users according to mobile phone behavior, but they pre-determined the qualities of the
profiles manually as opposed to clustering. Studies that did utilize clustering for mobile
phone analysis primarily focused on predicting the next app users would open. This research
uses logging data from the MobileDNA app from Ghent University to create standard phone
behavior features, as well as new ones that quantify notification response time. Principal
component analysis was conducted on the feature set before clustering using DBSCAN. The
clustering results assigned most users into one main clusters, which suggests that clustering
may not be the most appropriate method for user profiling and that users are better considered
with regard to a spectrum of behavior. Additionally, it found notification response time is an
important feature in differentiating users and should be included in future studies.</p></li>

        <p><em>Abstract:</em> This research examines the effect of Conversational Human Voice on User Experience in chatbots in the context
of survey research performed by the municipality of ’s-Hertogenbosch (The Netherlands). Literature of suggests
that Conversational Human Voice has a positive effect on User Experience, but that never has been tested.
Therefore, this study proposes the following first research question: What is the effect of Conversational Human
Voice on the User Experience? In the research of Human-Computer Interaction, it is known that humans are
likely to attribute human characteristics to the computer when they interact with them and show similarities to
Human-Human interaction. It is said that people tend to adapt their language use to that of their conversational
agent. Therefore, this study proposes the second research question: To what extent do users alter their language
use to the addition of elements of Conversational Human Voice of the chatbot? The results of 551 participants
were analysed and the following conclusions are drawn: Conversational Human Voice does not necessarily lead
to a higher User Experience score in the context of survey research. For the context of survey research, one can
rather stick to the functional communication styles. Compared to the other Conversational Human Voice
categories, inviting rhetoric seems most suitable in the context of survey research. Significant differences were
found for the “helpfulness” and “clearness” of the chatbots. All in all, chatbots do show potential, but mainly in
more bound contexts such as answering frequently asked questions or managing appointment.</p></li>

        <p><em>Abstract:</em> This thesis project used experimental, cross-situational, word-learning data, and the correct combination
of pseudo words and novel objects had to be identified in an ambiguous setting.
The first research question of this project aimed to identify which individual features could be used to
predict whether subjects would learn a word pair correctly in the testing phase. Based on the literature,
five potential features were identified and tested using a logistic regression and random forest algorithm.
The results showed that the more frequently a word-object
pair was presented without uncertainty, the more likely the pair was to be learned correctly.
The second research question focused on identifying different types of learners, as the literature showed
that different subjects may learn differently.
A Gaussian mixture model and hierarchical clustering were used, and clustering
analysis showed that the identified clusters were poorly separated and contained much noise.</p></li>

        <p><em>Abstract:</em> This thesis aims at predicting an image based on different texts describing that image and question asked
while guessing the image.
The main research question is to evaluate the self-sufficiency of text data to identify a portrait with the help of text mining and similarity measures.
We used two types of vector space model combined with two types of decision rules and one similarity measure that is cosine similarity.
In our research, term frequency and inverse document frequency performed the best with a precision of 49%.
This shows how text itself can help reduce number of alternatives at the time of decision making. This
seems very useful in the area where tasks related to finding suspects are concerned.
Moreover, retaining few parts of speech can be helpful to increase the speed of mining as they retain a lot
of information simultaneously reducing the noise. </p></li>

        <p><em>Abstract:</em> This study is a comparative analysis of supervised learning tasks using categorical texts and free-text
questions about facial details of people. The datasets used for this research were collected through online
experiments. This study used pre-trained word representations, which are known to be perform better than
the traditional text mining approaches. Categorical texts and word embeddings of question texts were
used as features in classification algorithms and their performances were evaluated with accuracy rates in
predicting answers to the questions. In other words, the research question was formed as “Which pretrained word embedding and classification models perform best in terms of accuracy rate in predicting
answers to yes/no questions?”
The findings showed that use of pre-trained word embedding models indeed led to better predictive
performances in some classification algorithms compared to the baseline for this dataset. </p></li>

        <p><em>Abstract:</em> This work investigates culture and cultural influence of visual narrative structures in
comic books, using a machine learning approach. It is motivated by proof that comics
are susceptible to adjustments stimulated by culture, and the scarcity of a machine
learning approach in studies on comics. Our main contribution is a better
understanding concerning cross-cultural differences in visual language, and evolvement
over time from a novel perspective. We find this contribution by asking the following
research question: To what extent can we predict continent, country, and decade of
publication based on narrative patterns in comic books published in the last eight
decades? The answer to this question is obtained by training a decision tree and naive
Bayes classifier, using narrative patterns extracted from the Visual Language Research
Corpus. The results demonstrate that there are cultural distinctions in patterns if we
examine continent or country of publication. However, if we examine decade of
publication we witness fewer characteristics pointing towards changes over time, unless
the time period investigated is of sufficient length, for example 50 years.</p></li>
