      <p><em>Abstract:</em> In professional cycling training schedules are optimized to perfection. But to know on beforehand
if the training schedule has the desired effect, there is the need to know what effect the training
had on race performance. In this research a logistic regression, a support vector machine and a
random forest are developed to predict race performance of a professional female cyclist, based on
training load. The data consists of the races and training of 2017-2019. The research question
that will be answered is: To what extent can race performance be predicted in cycling, based on
        training load?</p>
<p>Athlete data is often limited in size as athletes only can do a number of races per year which
makes the data impractical for predictive modelling. This study investigates which techniques are
helpful in classifying race performance. Class balancing is performed using weight adjustment
and the SMOTE technique. In addition to that, PCA is performed. The random forest with
weight adjustment gave the best result with a F1-score of 0.88, which shows that it is possible to
predict race performance with a small dataset. The PCA showed an improvement in prediction
for the SVM with an F1-score of 0.872, which is an improvement but not as high as the random
forest. This means that the PCA was not beneficial for this dataset.</p></li>

      <p><em>Abstract:</em> Amusement parks deal with crowdedness and managing this crowd almost every day.
This crowdedness may cause waiting times in general to get higher which in turn may cause
dissatisfied guests (Furnham, Treglown, and Horne 2020). The research field of managing flow
and capacity in amusement parks has been studying for several years how to control the crowds
using several methods mostly by running simulations (Ahmadi 1997; Cheng et al. 2013; Zhang,
Li, and Su 2017; Yuan and Zheng 2018). This study researches the effect of three different
crowd management methods on the waiting time of attractions and the crowd distribution in
amusement park the Efteling. The three methods are the placement of physical signing across the
park, the sending out of push notifications containing information and tips about crowdedness,
and a recommendation app for a phone to recommend attractions and restaurants. This research
will analyse these effects using data collected from real life. The data that is used for this study is
provided by amusement park the Efteling. The results show that none of the crowd management
methods have an effect on the waiting times nor the crowd distribution. However, these results
may be inaccurate and can be improved by further optimising the prediction models that are
used to compute the results.</p></li>

      <p><em>Abstract:</em> With the already 30000 unique game titles that are available on the Steam platform, and
developers releasing more games every year, the average gamer might be overwhelmed by the
abundance of game titles. To make sure the users of the platform don’t get lost in the game store,
there are systems working on the background, that make sure the users only gets to see relevant
games. These systems are called recommender systems, and they try to recommend games to the
user, based on the users’ past interests. The two most popular methods for recommending items
to users, are the collaborative filtering method and the content based filtering method. This study
focuses on these two methods, and tries to determine which of the two methods provides the best
recommendations for the users of Steam. The data used for this study contained information
about the what games each user owned, how long each user played a game and the characteristics
of each game. First the collaborative model was constructed, which combines the individual
interests with the opinions of other users to predict recommendations. Then the content based
model was constructed, which focuses more on the contents and the characteristics of a game. The
results of this study showed that the collaborative filtering method was superior to the content
based method, which corresponds with the research that already has been conducted on this topic.

      <p><em>Abstract:</em> For this thesis, the predictive performances of Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods
have been researched for predicting Mixed Martial Arts matches. The goal of this study was
to answer the research question What is the difference in the prediction performance that can
be achieved by DL models compared to traditional ML models by predicting MMA matches?
During this study, a Random Forest and an Artificial Neural Network were trained on data
        from the past 22 years. The data is made available by the Ultimate Fighting Championship.</p>
<p>Two data sets were scraped from www.ufcstats.com. These were then combined into a
single data set. During the feature engineering process, great emphasis was put on preventing
information leakage from occurring. Using random search algorithms for hyperparameter
tuning, the Random Forest and Neural Network were able to achieve test set accuracies of
58.98% and 59.11% respectively. These accuracies are in-line with the results of other similar
studies focusing on sports prediction. So it is hard to say if the sport of Mixed Martial Arts
  is more or less predictable compared to other sports that have commonly been researched.</p>
<p>However, information leakage is not always taken into account while building models for
sport prediction. An additional set of models were trained to find out what the effect would
be if no precautions were taken to prevent information leakage. The Random Forest and
Neural Network models with information leakage achieved test set accuracies of 65.11% and
        68.59% respectively.</p>
<p>The results of this thesis highlight the predictive performance of Random Forests and
Neural Networks with regards to Mixed Martial Arts predictions. In addition, the results
also highlight the effects of information leakage, not just in sports prediction, but in all
of Machine Learning. Insufficient measures to prevent information leakage can lead to too
optimistic results, which are not realistically achievable in real-life settings once a model is
deployed.</p></li>

      <p><em>Abstract:</em> The goal of this research was to determine if clustering mobile phone data can be used to
segment users into groups based on their behavior. Previous studies have attempted to profile
users according to mobile phone behavior, but they pre-determined the qualities of the
profiles manually as opposed to clustering. Studies that did utilize clustering for mobile
phone analysis primarily focused on predicting the next app users would open. This research
uses logging data from the MobileDNA app from Ghent University to create standard phone
behavior features, as well as new ones that quantify notification response time. Principal
component analysis was conducted on the feature set before clustering using DBSCAN. The
clustering results assigned most users into one main clusters, which suggests that clustering
may not be the most appropriate method for user profiling and that users are better considered
with regard to a spectrum of behavior. Additionally, it found notification response time is an
important feature in differentiating users and should be included in future studies.</p></li>

        <p><em>Abstract:</em> This research examines the effect of Conversational Human Voice on User Experience in chatbots in the context
of survey research performed by the municipality of ’s-Hertogenbosch (The Netherlands). Literature of suggests
that Conversational Human Voice has a positive effect on User Experience, but that never has been tested.
Therefore, this study proposes the following first research question: What is the effect of Conversational Human
Voice on the User Experience? In the research of Human-Computer Interaction, it is known that humans are
likely to attribute human characteristics to the computer when they interact with them and show similarities to
Human-Human interaction. It is said that people tend to adapt their language use to that of their conversational
agent. Therefore, this study proposes the second research question: To what extent do users alter their language
use to the addition of elements of Conversational Human Voice of the chatbot? The results of 551 participants
were analysed and the following conclusions are drawn: Conversational Human Voice does not necessarily lead
to a higher User Experience score in the context of survey research. For the context of survey research, one can
rather stick to the functional communication styles. Compared to the other Conversational Human Voice
categories, inviting rhetoric seems most suitable in the context of survey research. Significant differences were
found for the “helpfulness” and “clearness” of the chatbots. All in all, chatbots do show potential, but mainly in
more bound contexts such as answering frequently asked questions or managing appointment.</p></li>

        <p><em>Abstract:</em> This thesis project used experimental, cross-situational, word-learning data, and the correct combination
of pseudo words and novel objects had to be identified in an ambiguous setting.
The first research question of this project aimed to identify which individual features could be used to
predict whether subjects would learn a word pair correctly in the testing phase. Based on the literature,
five potential features were identified and tested using a logistic regression and random forest algorithm.
The results showed that the more frequently a word-object
pair was presented without uncertainty, the more likely the pair was to be learned correctly.
The second research question focused on identifying different types of learners, as the literature showed
that different subjects may learn differently.
A Gaussian mixture model and hierarchical clustering were used, and clustering
analysis showed that the identified clusters were poorly separated and contained much noise.</p></li>

        <p><em>Abstract:</em> This thesis aims at predicting an image based on different texts describing that image and question asked
while guessing the image.
The main research question is to evaluate the self-sufficiency of text data to identify a portrait with the help of text mining and similarity measures.
We used two types of vector space model combined with two types of decision rules and one similarity measure that is cosine similarity.
In our research, term frequency and inverse document frequency performed the best with a precision of 49%.
This shows how text itself can help reduce number of alternatives at the time of decision making. This
seems very useful in the area where tasks related to finding suspects are concerned.
Moreover, retaining few parts of speech can be helpful to increase the speed of mining as they retain a lot
of information simultaneously reducing the noise. </p></li>

        <p><em>Abstract:</em> This study is a comparative analysis of supervised learning tasks using categorical texts and free-text
questions about facial details of people. The datasets used for this research were collected through online
experiments. This study used pre-trained word representations, which are known to be perform better than
the traditional text mining approaches. Categorical texts and word embeddings of question texts were
used as features in classification algorithms and their performances were evaluated with accuracy rates in
predicting answers to the questions. In other words, the research question was formed as “Which pretrained word embedding and classification models perform best in terms of accuracy rate in predicting
answers to yes/no questions?”
The findings showed that use of pre-trained word embedding models indeed led to better predictive
performances in some classification algorithms compared to the baseline for this dataset. </p></li>

        <p><em>Abstract:</em> This work investigates culture and cultural influence of visual narrative structures in
comic books, using a machine learning approach. It is motivated by proof that comics
are susceptible to adjustments stimulated by culture, and the scarcity of a machine
learning approach in studies on comics. Our main contribution is a better
understanding concerning cross-cultural differences in visual language, and evolvement
over time from a novel perspective. We find this contribution by asking the following
research question: To what extent can we predict continent, country, and decade of
publication based on narrative patterns in comic books published in the last eight
decades? The answer to this question is obtained by training a decision tree and naive
Bayes classifier, using narrative patterns extracted from the Visual Language Research
Corpus. The results demonstrate that there are cultural distinctions in patterns if we
examine continent or country of publication. However, if we examine decade of
publication we witness fewer characteristics pointing towards changes over time, unless
the time period investigated is of sufficient length, for example 50 years.</p></li>
